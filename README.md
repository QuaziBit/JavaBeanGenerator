# JavaBeen Generator

The idea was to generate a plane Java Class from the CSV file with the ability to determine a type of each field in a CSV file based on the provided initial value for each field.

You can find example of such CS file in the "rsc" folder.

I did not finish this project, but it is giving right result if you will run it from Eclipse IDE.
